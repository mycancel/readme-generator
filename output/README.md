## License

The Berkeley Source Distribution (BSD)  License is another permissive open source license that preserves license notices and copyrights but allows larger or licensed works to be distributed without source code and under different license terms. The 2- clause BSD License is very similar to the MIT open source license, while the 3-clause and 4-clause BSD licenses add more requirements or restrictions related to reuse and other terms ( [Source](https://snyk.io/learn/open-source-licenses/) ).
