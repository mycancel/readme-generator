## Description

Using starter code provided by [UNC Charlotte Bootcamp](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma), this project uses node.js and the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer#documentation) to generate README markdowns with information inputed by the user. After answering questions in the command line, the markdown is generated in the output folder.

## Usage

[Instructional Video]()

After downloading the code, start the program by typing ```node index.js``` in the GitBash terminal. Follow the instructions in the console by answering the questions and providing descriptions to be added to the README later. When prompted to select from a list of licenses, use the keyboard's arrow keys to scroll up and down to the desired item before pressing enter. Alternatively, select the list item by pressing its associated number before pressing enter.
